        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg unripe mangoes or 8 cups chopped mangoes</li>
            <li>200 grams mustard seeds or 1 cup + 4 tablespoon mustard seeds</li>
            <li>20 grams fenugreek seeds or 2 tablespoon fenugreek seeds </li>
            <li>200 grams kashmiri red chili powder or 2 cups kashmiri red chili powder</li>
            <li>200 grams rock salt (edible and food grade) or 1 cup rock salt or pink salt</li>
            <li>2 cups sesame oil (gingelly oil) – cold pressed or wood pressed</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Steps</h3>
    
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First, begin by sun drying the mustard seeds for a day or for at least 4 to 5 hours. This is to get rid of any dampness or moisture in them.</li>
            <li>Also, sun dry fenugreek seeds and red chili powder for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, soak the unripe mangoes in water for 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Then, rinse them well and if there is any sticky sap which has dried on the mangoes, rub the mangoes in your palms when rinsing to remove the dried sap.</li>
            <li>Remove the mangoes. Dry them with a clean kitchen towel or naturally.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h4>Chopping Mangoes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Before chopping mangoes, they should be completely dry. There should not be any trace of moisture or water on the mangoes.</li>
            <li>Firstly, slice the mango in halves from its center. This is very difficult as the kernel is hard and the knife does not cut it easily. So please avoid, if you cannot do this chopping.</li>
            <li>Then, take each halve and remove the seeds carefully with a knife. The kernel part will be intact on the mangoes.</li>
            <li>Now, halve the mango vertically from the center first. Then, cut horizontally.</li>
            <li>Now, halve the mango vertically from the center first. Then, cut horizontally.</li>
            <li>Take the mango pieces and remove the thin paper like covering from the kernel part with a spoon or with your hands. Make sure that your hands are clean.</li>
            <li>Take the chopped mangoes in a large pan or bowl. Cover and keep aside.
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <h4>Making the Aavakaya Pachadi</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the mustard seeds. They should be warm before you grind them. Add in a mixer or grinder-jar or a spice grinder and grind to a semi fine powder. Remove the mustard powder and add to mango pieces.
            </li>
            <li>In the same jar, add fenugreek seeds. Grind to a semi fine powder and add to the mango pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Now add the red chili powder. 
            </li>
            <li>Add rock salt. You can even use sea salt crystals or Himalayan pink salt. Use salt which is non iodized. If using sea salt crystals, then powder in a mixer and then add.</li>
            <li>Mix very well with a large spoon.
            </li>
            <li>Now, add sesame oil or gingelly oil. Use cold pressed sesame oil (kachchi ghani) and not refined sesame oil. 
            </li>
            <li>Mix very well and thoroughly with a large spoon.
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <h4>Storing</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover with a lid (not tightly) and keep the mango Aavakaya in a dry place for 4 to 5 days. 
            </li>
            <li>Everyday or alternate day, remove the lid and mix the pickle with a clean spoon. You can sun dry the spoon for some minutes before you mix the pickle.
            </li>
            <li>On the fourth or fifth day, you will see oil floating on top of the pickle and the mango pieces would have already softened. Mix again with a clean spoon.
            </li>
            <li>Add the pickle in a clean jar or bottle. Do wash the glass jar or bottle and then sun dry it for a day before storing the pickle. 
            </li>
            <li>Close the lid and refrigerate. You can even keep the pickle in a dry place for 2 to 3 days more and then refrigerate.
            </li>
            <li>When serving avakai, remove the portion you want in a small jar from the main jar and then serve with your everyday meals. If the oil on top becomes less, then add some more sesame oil, so that the pickle is covered with oil. 
            </li>
        </ol>
